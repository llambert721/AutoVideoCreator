## Why?
I see these kinds of videos all across Tiktok constantly! I thought why not automate the process of downloading and editing the videos (and learn Python as this is my first project!).

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+

## Installation
- Clone this repository using `git clone https://github.com/EvilWumpus/AutoVideoCreator.git`
  - Or download from [releases](https://github.com/EvilWumpus/AutoVideoCreator/releases)
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Run `python main.py`
- You can configure bot in the `config.toml` file
- Enjoy!

## Contributing
The bot is fully complete but a few improvements can still be made!

All contributions are greatly appreciated, dont be nervous to contribute even if you are a beginner like me.
- [ ] Improve video quality (current 720p)
- [ ] Add config option to limit amount of PT's created
- [ ] Add more bottom videos if top videos longer
- [ ] Improve readability of code (more comments are greatly needed)
- [ ] Automatic youtube video scraper <br />

If you have anymore suggestions please contact me or make an issue.
